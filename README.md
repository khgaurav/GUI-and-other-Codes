# GUI-and-other-Codes
This is the personal repoitory of all the codes created by me.

1)	It contains all the files for the GUI created for Mars Rover Manipal 2019 team. It was created using pyqt5 on python2.7. I
		have also used pyqtgraph for mapping GPS co-ordinates and IMU values of the rover to get a sense of it's position.
		
2)	Socket programming on python using TCP and UDP for transmitting and recieving data over network.

3)	Pygame interface with a joystick to get positions of different axes and status of buttons on the joystick. This is used to 		 manipulate the rover's and robotic arm's movement based on it.

4)	OpenCV integration with pyqt5 to access IP camera feed over a network and display it on the GUI.
